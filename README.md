# Heart-Rate-Monitor-From-ECG-Signal-Using-Filters
This project proposes a heart rate monitor using ECG signals for real-time measurement. Signal processing techniques, including FIR/IIR filtering and R-peak detection, extract heart rate accurately. Implemented in MATLAB, ensuring reliability for clinical, wearable, and telemedicine applications.
